# game-of-life
My implementation of Conway's Game of Life. See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life

**Requirements**: pygame

To run, use:

```
python3 src/life.py
```

Note that with the code as it is, there will be no live cells in the initial configuration. Add some shapes in using the ``PatternMaker``.
